A. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Graph ADT with an adjacency matrix. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Graph ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Search
4. Display
5. Exit


B. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Graph ADT with an adjacency list. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Graph ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Search
4. Display
5. Exit


C. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Graph ADT with the implementation for Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, and Dijkstra’s algorithm. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.
